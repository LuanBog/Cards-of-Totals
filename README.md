# Cards Of Totals

This game is inspired by Gelo, man showed me a card game and I was inspired to make it into an indie game

## How To Play

- 2 players will choose 2 cards in the deck and they will look at it and sum up the number
- They will have a choice if they want to play it or surrender it if they think their hand is strong or weak
- Once the choosing is done and the 2 players decides to play. They will show their hand and whoever has the highest total of cards win
